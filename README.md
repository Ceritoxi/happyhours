# happyhours
Hours that are incredibly happy for some odd, but fashionable reason.


Use **logaday.bat** to make a timestamp at day start and do it again when your day ends.
You can query you current status with **queryhours.bat**.

You can shut down you computer and make a timestamp with **satdaun.bat**, tho be careful cuz it's kinda merciless.

You can make happyhours start on windows startup by inserting a shortcut of **logaday.bat** into the windows startup folder.

Do the following:
  - right click on **logaday.bat** and select **Create Shortcut**
  - press **WindowsKey** + **R**
  - type "shell:startup" into it
  - copy the created shortcut into the folder that you just opened
  - ???
  - profit
